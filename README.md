# LIRI
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

App was created using NodeJS with the following packages and technologies:
* Inquirer
* Request
* Node Spotify API
* Twitter API
* OMDB API

In order to run the program, ensure your computer has Node installed and do the following:
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate your terminal into the liri-node-app directory
3. Install dependencies using `npm i --save` in the command line
4. Input `node liri.js`

Now you can check my most recent tweets with the twitter API, get info on a song with the Spotify API, get info on a movie using the OMDB API, or do something random.  All commands input into liri are logged into the log.txt file.
